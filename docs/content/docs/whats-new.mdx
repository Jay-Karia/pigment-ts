#### Support for HSLA and RGBA formats

PigmentTS now supports HSLA and RGBA color formats. You can now convert colors to HSLA and RGBA formats using the `convertColor` function.

```ts
import { convertColor } from "pigment-ts";

// Convert HEX to HSLA
const hsla = convertColor("#ff5733", "hsla");
console.log(hsla); // 'hsla(9, 100%, 57%, 1)'
```

#### New utility functions for opacity control and color blending

PigmentTS now includes new utility functions for opacity control and color blending. You can now adjust the opacity of a color using the `setOpacity` function and blend two colors together using the `blendColors` function.

```ts
import { setOpacity, blendColors } from "pigment-ts";

// Set opacity to 50%
const opaqueColor = setOpacity("#ff5733", 0.5);
console.log(opaqueColor); // 'rgba(255, 87, 51, 0.5)'

// Blend two colors together
const blendedColor = blendColors("#ff5733", "#3366ff", 0.5);
console.log(blendedColor); // '#7f8aff'
```

#### Optimized codebase for better performance and reduced bundle size

PigmentTS has been optimized for better performance and reduced bundle size. The codebase has been refactored to improve performance and reduce the overall bundle size of the library.
