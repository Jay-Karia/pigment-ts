## Coding Guidelines

- **TypeScript first**: Ensure the code is written in TypeScript. If you're introducing a new feature, make sure the types are well defined.
- **ESLint**: We use ESLint to enforce code style. Please ensure your code passes linting.
- **Formatting**: Run `npm run format` to format your code using Prettier.
- **Testing**: Write tests for any new features or bug fixes. We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for testing, so make sure your tests cover all relevant cases.
